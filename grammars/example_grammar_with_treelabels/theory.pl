% ALE never had support for "unfilling", at least in one reading of that term,
% until now.
%   But now it does.  We're not going to call it unfilling ,however, because
% that term has been so molested that it's going to confuse everyone.  We'll
% call it "sparse output."
%   To turn this on, use ale_flag(sparseoutput,_,on).

% Gert: this hides features whose values are most general

:- ale_flag(sparseoutput,_,on).

%%% Procedural constraint using cuts in order to do cases. The cases need to be ordered from most specific to most general. The final case can be very general.

phrase *> (P,        % this variable refers to the phrase as a whole, since we
           head_dtr:H) goal pied_piping(P,H).   % want to feed it into the procedural attachment.

% On the right hand side above, we need to identify all the signs that play a role in pied-piping

pied_piping((@vp,wh:e_list),(wh:e_list)) if !.
pied_piping((pp,wh:Wh),(comps:wh:Wh)) if !.
pied_piping(((@np;@ap),wh:Wh),(spr:wh:Wh)) if true.

% Gerald: all the relations can be made into functions, even those that make use of cuts. Then you get default functions.

% Gerald: Stefan uses a lot of if-A-than-B-else-C (shallow cuts). If Trale can prove A, then it does not backtrack into A (but it will backtrack into B or C). The choice of A is committed.

Example:


(word,
 ... verb) *> V
goal (V = vform:pas) -> V = (subcat:S,
                            arg_st:[_|S])
                       ;
                       V = (subcat:S,
                            arg_st:S).

You can list as many cases as you like:

(word,
 ... verb) *> V
goal (V = vform:pas) -> V = (subcat:S,
                            arg_st:[_|S])
     ;
     (V = vform:fin) -> whatever should hold of the second case
     ;
     (V = vform:psp) -> whatever should hold of the third case
     ; %everything except for the VFORMS above
     V = (subcat:S,
          arg_st:S).
     
     

Gerald: if you get unwanted duplicate solutions, then try using cuts.

multifile and discontiguous

In all files that have macros, at the top you issue a

multifile macro/2.

directive.


discontiguous means that within ONE file, not all the macros may be contiguous.
